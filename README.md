# humaneAI_LLM_macroproject

This repository currently maintains the relevant papers we want to share among the peers within the HumaneAI macroproject. There are two directories.

1. papers: to commit relevant papers
2. reports_and_etc: to commit other resources such as technical reports, presentations and documents that are not research manuscripts.
